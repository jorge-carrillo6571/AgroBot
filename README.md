Autonomous Pest-Control Robot: Tackling Global Crop Losses This project presents an autonomous robot designed to combat crop pests, which destroy 40% of global agricultural production. Using LiDAR, YOLOv8, and RRT*, it maps fields, detects pests, logs environmental data, and autonomously returns to base.
